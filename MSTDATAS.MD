# The MNIST database
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

# Get the Data

Many ML libraries already include Fashion-MNIST data/API, give it a try!

You can use direct links to download the dataset. The data is stored in the same format as the original MNIST data.

# Labels
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

Label	Description
0	T-shirt/top
1	Trouser
2	Pullover
3	Dress
4	Coat
5	Sandal
6	Shirt

# Interpret a buffer as a 1-dimensional array.

numpy.frombuffer(buffer, dtype=float, count=-1, offset=0)Â¶

# Parameters:
* buffer: buffer_like
* An object that exposes the buffer interface.

# dtype: data-type, optional
* Data-type of the returned array: 
- int8 Byte (-128 to 127)

* default: float.

# count: int, optional
* Number of items to read. -1 means all data in the buffer. ALL THE BUFFER

# offset: int, optional
* Start reading the buffer from this offset(in bytes) default: 0.  
- offset=8


# reshape(len(y_train), 28, 28)
* redimentionne l'imaghe en 28x28

Please note that your browser may uncompress these files without telling you.
If the files you downloaded have a larger size than the above, they have been uncompressed by your browser. Simply rename them to remove the .gz extension. Some people have asked me "my application can't open your image files". These files are not in any standard image format. You have to write your own (very simple) program to read them. The file format is described at the bottom of this page.
